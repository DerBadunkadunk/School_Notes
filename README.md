## 🗂 How to Organize Your Notes

A good `.md` file is easy to read and scan. Use this structure:

1. **Title & Description**  
   Start with `#` for the main heading and a short explanation of what the file is about.

2. **Table of Contents (Optional)**  
   Create a clickable list of sections for long files:
   ```md
   - [Overview](#overview)
   - [Setup](#setup)
   - [Usage](#usage)
   - [Tips](#tips)
   - [Reference](#reference)
